//one way to create an array is to use an array literal
//It wrapping items in square brackets[]
//arrays can store any data type
//the array is represented by the square brackets[]
//each content item inside an array is called an element
//each element is seperated by a comma
//each element inside this array is a different data type

const hobbies = ['music', 'sports', 'art'];
console.log(hobbies);

//Each element in an array has a numbered position know as its index
//Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, the positions start counting from 0, the first item in an array will be at position 0

let listItem = ['music'];
console.log(listItem);
//[] with the index after the name of the array to access the element
