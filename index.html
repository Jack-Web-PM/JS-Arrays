//one way to create an array is to use an array literal
//It wrapping items in square brackets[]
//arrays can store any data type
//the array is represented by the square brackets[]
//each content item inside an array is called an element
//each element is seperated by a comma
//each element inside this array is a different data type

const hobbies = ['music', 'sports', 'art'];
console.log(hobbies);

//Each element in an array has a numbered position know as its index
//Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, the positions start counting from 0, the first item in an array will be at position 0

let listItem = ['music'];
console.log(listItem);
//[] with the index after the name of the array to access the element


let seasons = ['winter', 'spring', 'summer', 'fall'];
seasons[3] = 'autumn';
console.log(seasons);

//JS Arrays[1] notes //Date: 2/13/25
//Arrays with let and const; May recall that and declare viriables with bot the let and const keywords,
//Variables declared with let can be reassingned; Varaibles declared with the const cannot be reassigned.
//elements in an array declared with const remain mutable, means can change the contents, but cannot reassign a new array

const condiments = ['Ketchup','Mustard','Relish'];
condiments[2] = 'Mayo';
const utensils = ['fork','spoon','knife'];
utensils[utensils.length] = 'Spork';
console.log(utensils);
console.log(utensils.length-2);
//cannot remodify the array

console.log(newYearsResolutions.length);
console.log(newYearsResolutions.length-1);//Output: 2

//.push() Method; these methods are specifically called on arrays to make common tasks, like adding and removing elements, more straightforward
//push() or add comma after an array
//example: 
const itemTracker = ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2'];
itemTracker.push('item 3', 'item 4');
console.log(itemTracker);
// Output: ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3', 'item 4'];
// .push() can access the push method by using dot notation, after we call it like a function, .push() can take a single argument or multiple arguments seperated by commas

//practice
const chores = ['A', 'B'];
chores.push('3','4');
const remove = chores.pop();
console.log(remove);
console.log(chores);

//.pop() Method; it removes the last item of an array
const newItemTracker = ['item 0','item 1','item 2'];
const removed = newItemTracker.pop();
console.log(newItemTracker);
// Output: [ 'item 0', 'item 1' ]
console.log(removed);
// Output: item 2

//.pop() method does not take any arguments, it returns the value of the last element, its a method that mutates the initial array
